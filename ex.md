# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) ‚Äì VCN, Security Lists, and CIDR Blocks

## üîπ Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
- A **VCN (Virtual Cloud Network)** in OCI is like your own private data center in the cloud.
- In this example, we‚Äôre creating a **VCN with a /16 CIDR block**.
- Subnets inside the VCN will use smaller ranges (e.g., `/24`).

## üîπ Security Lists: Ingress & Egress
- **Ingress rules**: Control incoming traffic (who can reach your resources).  
- **Egress rules**: Control outgoing traffic (where your resources can connect to).  
- These are used to **allow or disable specific port traffic** (like SSH, HTTPS, etc.).

**Example Rules:**
- Ingress: Allow TCP 22 (SSH) from your IP.
- Ingress: Allow TCP 443 (HTTPS) from the internet.
- Egress: Allow all TCP 443 (outbound HTTPS) for system updates.

## üîπ CIDR Blocks and Overlaps
- CIDR blocks define the **IP address range** of your VCN.
- **Important:** You don‚Äôt want overlapping CIDRs between VCNs or subnets.
- Overlaps cause **routing conflicts** and break **VCN peering / connectivity**.

**Bad Example (Overlap):**
- VCN A: `10.0.0.0/16`
- VCN B: `10.0.0.0/16` ‚ùå

**Good Example (No Overlap):**
- VCN A: `10.0.0.0/16`
- VCN B: `10.1.0.0/16` ‚úÖ

## üîπ Putting It All Together
Below are examples of how a VCN is structured with CIDR blocks, subnets, and security lists:

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways
- **VCN** defines your private network space using CIDR blocks.  
- **Security Lists** use Ingress/Egress rules to control **port traffic**.  
- **Avoid overlapping CIDRs** to prevent routing and peering conflicts.
